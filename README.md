## Hi, im Westrain  
Full-stack developer focused on simplicity, efficiency, and clean code.  
I build projects that are practical, user-friendly, and browser-based.  
Always learning, always iterating.

## Projects  

- **Space Ship Defense**  
  A mobile browser-based tower defense game set in deep space. Touch controls, upgradeable features, and increasingly challenging enemy waves.

- **IP & Location Recon**  
  A responsive web tool that displays the user's IP address and geolocation info using public APIs. Simple, fast, and accurate.

- **DarkView Portfolio Site**  
  A clean, terminal-inspired personal portfolio site with smooth animations and a dark aesthetic. Showcases skills and projects with a developer-first UI.
